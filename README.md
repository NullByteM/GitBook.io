# Writeups

I am a motivated and detail-oriented **junior penetration tester** with a strong passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. With a solid foundation in **networking, Linux systems, and web security**, I actively engage in practical labs and real-world testing environments to enhance my skills. I enjoy working with tools such as **Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, Hydra**, and various CTF platforms including **TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and VulnHub**, where I practice exploitation, privilege escalation, and vulnerability assessment.

Currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information** at the University of Luxor, I have worked on a graduation project called **HosGenZy**, an IoT- and blockchain-based smart healthcare system aimed at improving data security and hospital efficiency. I am continuously learning and developing my expertise in application security, cryptography, and OSINT techniques.

I thrive in collaborative environments, value clear technical communication, and enjoy solving complex security challenges. With a strong desire to grow in the cybersecurity field, I aim to contribute to securing systems through hands-on testing and continuous innovation.
